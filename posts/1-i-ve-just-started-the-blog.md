Finally, after like 8 years, I've started a blog. (My website was under
construction for 8 years. Really!)

It's quite simple and buggy now though, but I'll improve on that.

# Blog generator
I've made a static blog generator because nothing was good enough. I badly
wanted to use React in my blog, but, there was no static blog generator that
fits my use.

Actually, there was only one React static blog generator:
[Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs). But it currently saves whole article
data into single JS file. Which is very horrible for scaling.
[There's an GitHub issue for this.](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/431)

So I made a [blog generator](https://github.com/yoo2001818/kkiro.kr) suitable
for my use. But since it's quite complicated, I'm having a problem separating
the generator and the website. (It's not heavily tied with each other though)
I'll write detailed article about it later.

# Multilingual support?
I'm planning to make multilingual support for this blog to support Korean.
Probably later.
