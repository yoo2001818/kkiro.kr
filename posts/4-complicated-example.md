# Complicated Example
This is complicated example of markdown rendering.

## Why use Markdown?

- It's **simple**
- It's easy to read in *plaintext*
- It's ***awesome***
- It's ~~supported in my blog~~
- It supports <font color="#ff0000">raw HTML</font>
  - It supports list hierarchy
  - For no reason
    - Uhh...
    - Whatever.

## How do I use Markdown?

1. Just write documents like it's plaintext
2. You're done
3. Render it
   1. I personally like to use `marked`
   2. Eh.
4. Upload it to somewhere

# Let's go deeper
## Deeper...
### Even Deeper...
#### Even even deeper...
##### Even even more deeper...
###### Deepest level!

# GitHub Flavored Markdown

```javascript
function stuff() {
  stuff();
}
```

It's a table! | Why?
--------------|------
I don't even like table | Why not?
Because it's not fancy | ...In where?
In Markdown document | Okay.

# And more...

***

^ This shouldn't generate 'Read more...'

## Can't we use relative image address or something?
We can't... yet.
